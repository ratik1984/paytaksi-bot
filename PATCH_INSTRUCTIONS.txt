PAYTAKSI - BOLT STYLE LIVE DRIVERS (OSM/Leaflet) + WAZE (Additive Patch)

What this patch adds:
- Passenger endpoint: GET /api/passenger/nearby_drivers?lat=...&lon=...&radius_km=3
  Returns nearby ONLINE drivers (fresh pings) as icons for the passenger map.
- Passenger UI: live driver icons on the Leaflet map (updates every 3 seconds, smooth movement).
- Driver UI: Waze navigation buttons (Pickup / Drop) on each ride card.
- SQL patch: adds driver location + online columns safely (IF NOT EXISTS).

Install:
1) Extract this ZIP into your project root (same level as src/, db/, package.json). Overwrite when asked.
2) Run SQL patch:
   db/patches/20260215_passenger_nearby_drivers_live.sql
3) Deploy / restart the service.

Notes:
- Radius is 3km by default in the passenger endpoint. Passenger UI requests radius_km=3.
- Fare already matches your tariff in server.js: BASE_FARE=3.50, BASE_KM=3.0, PER_KM_AFTER=0.40.
